This is still a work in progress project that will primarily be utilising C++ to implement a lot of the logic

Some of the main features that will be getting looked into will be the Gameplay Ability System, Blackboards/Behaviour Trees and UI programming

On top of this, there will be aspects looked into that aren't part of this such as subsystems to control volume controls and animation BP setups and offsets
